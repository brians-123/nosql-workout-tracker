## Description <a id="description"></a> :page_facing_up:

This application tracks daily workouts, allowing for multiple exercies to be accomplished per day. There is a separate dashboard page which leverages chart.js to present a graphical representation of the data. The app leverages MongoDB to store data and Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to fit a more rigid data structure.

## User Story <a id="user-story"></a> :woman:

As an athlete, I want a way to track my individual cardio and resistance workouts over multiple days, including the type of exercise and applicable stats like reps, sets, weight, distance and duration on my mobile phone while working out. I should have the ability to pickup my workout where I left off if I have a connection issue so that I can better plan the following week's workout schedule and goals.
